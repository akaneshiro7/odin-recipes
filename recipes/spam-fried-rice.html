            <p>This spam fried rice with egg is one that I really 
                enjoy and if you're not a fan of spam, you can replace 
                it with ham or bacon or just remove it.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat, 
                    fry your spam until golden brown on each side. 
                    Then toss in your shallots. Fry until the shallots have softened.</li>
                <li>Next add in avocado oil, green onions and garlic. 
                    Give this is a stir and push this to the side of your pan.</li>
                <li>Then add in corn, peas and carrots. Fry and combine with the 
                    other ingredients. Then push this to the side.</li>
                <li>Pour in your whisked eggs. Allow this to cook 
                    and then break into bite size pieces. Push this to the side.</li>
                <li>Add in cooked rice followed by soy sauce, dark soy sauce, butter, 
                    and salt. Toss until the rice and other ingredients are well 
                    combined and evenly coated. Every grain should be brown.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and drizzle sesame oil over. This should be the last 
                    step as sesame oil tends to change taste when it's over heated.</li>
            </ol>
