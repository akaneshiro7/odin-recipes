        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is an easy breakfast recipe that I make every
                week in college. It is simple and does not require 
                a lot of ingredients. This meal can also be eaten 
                straight out of the pan.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Strips Bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
                <li>6 cups (about 3/4 of 30 ounce bag) 
                    frozen cubed southern style hash browns, 
                    fresh potatoes can also be used</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white onion</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>1 clove minced garlic, (this is optional)</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions, (optional)</li>
            </ul>    
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat until crisp. 
                    Remove bacon and drain on paper towels, leaving about 2 tablespoons 
                    of drippings in the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add onion and potatoes to the pan stirring to coat in bacon drippings 
                    and cook for a couple of minutes. Add water and cover skillet. 
                    Cook for 15 minutes or until soft, only flipping once or twice. 
                    When you let the potatoes sit without flipping, they get nice and brown. 
                    Stir in garlic and cook for a minute. Add more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Make four wells in the potatoes, exposing the skillet underneath. 
                    Carefully, crack the egg in each spot. Cover skillet and let eggs 
                    cook over low heat until egg whites are set, about 8-10 minutes. 
                    Sprinkle cheese and bacon on top during the last couple minutes of cooking. 
                    Sprinkle with green onions and serve. </li>
            </ol>
